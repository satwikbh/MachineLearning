# MachineLearning

My experiments with various machine learning algorithms. 

Following are the various algorithms I have worked on:

1. Linear Dimensionality Reduction Techniques
	* Singular Value Decomposition
	* Principal Component Analysis 
2. Non Linear Dimensionality Reduction Techniques
	* Local Linear Embedding
	* t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding
	* Stacked AutoEncoders
3. Clustering
	* Hierachical Clustering Algorithm
4. Miscellaneous
	* Gap Statistic to determine optimal value of K in k-means
