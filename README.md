# MachineLearning

My experiments with various machine learning algorithms.

Following are the various algorithms I have worked on:

1. Linear Dimensionality Reduction Techniques
	* Singular Value Decomposition
	* Principal Component Analysis
2. Non Linear Dimensionality Reduction Techniques
	* Local Linear Embedding
	* t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding
	* Stacked AutoEncoders
3. Clustering
	* Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm
4. Miscellaneous
	* Gap Statistic to determine optimal value of K in k-means

### IMP:
* All the models are stored at **models** in config file.
* Best parameters for Dim Red. are stored at **dr_params**.
* Clustering results are stored at **clustering_results**.
